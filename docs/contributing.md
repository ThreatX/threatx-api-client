## Bug reports

A bug is a verifiable issue that is caused by the code in the repository.
Clear and detailed bug reports are extremely valuable.

### Guideline:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported
   in [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/ThreatX/threatx-api-client/issues).
2. Check if the case is still actual and is reproducible using the latest main branch.
3. Isolate the problem and provide list of actions required to reproduce problematic behaviour.
4. Open the issue ticket with all the findings.

A good bug report should provide all the necessary information upfront,
so others donâ€™t need to follow up for clarification.
Please try to include as many details as possible in your report.

#### Report example:

> Short and descriptive title
>
> A summary If possible, include the steps required to reproduce the issue.
>
> 1. First step
> 2. Second step
> 3. Etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

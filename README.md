## Examples

### **Class initialization**

```python
tx_api = Client("prod", "apikeytest1234")
```

### **Single request**

```python
tx_api.method(
    {
        "command": "get",
        "customer_name": "random_test_tenant",
        "name": "randomsite1.com"
    }
)
```

For a single request, the list brackets should be omitted in payload.
The response type depends on the input type used and the API response type.

#### Output example:

```
{'hash': 1000000000001, 'hostname': 'randomsite1.com', ... }
```

### **Multiple requests**

```python
sites = ["randomsite1.com", "randomsite2.com", "randomsite3.com"]
tx_api.method([
    {
        "command": "get",
        "customer_name": "random_test_tenant",
        "name": site
    } for site in sites
])
```

Use list of dicts to send a batch of payloads and process them asynchronously.  
The response will be the list of data entries.

#### Output example:

```
[
{'hash': 1000000000001, 'hostname': 'randomsite1.com', ...,}
{'hash': 1000000000002, 'hostname': 'randomsite2.com', ...},
{'hash': 1000000000003, 'hostname': 'randomsite3.com', ...}
]
```

### **Multiple marked requests**

```python
sites = ["randomsite1.com", "randomsite2.com", "randomsite3.com"]
tx_api.method([
    {
        "command": "get",
        "customer_name": "random_test_tenant",
        "name": site,
        "marker_var": site
    } for site in sites
])
```

The same as "Multiple requests" but with "marker_var" entry added to each request.  
Marker variable will be returned with each request which it was attached to as a key and the response as its value. It
could be useful for a further filtering/processing steps.

#### Output example:

```
[
{'randomsite1.com': {'hash': 1000000000001, 'hostname': 'randomsite1.com', ...}},
{'randomsite2.com': {'hash': 1000000000002, 'hostname': 'randomsite2.com', ...}},
{'randomsite3.com': {'hash': 1000000000003, 'hostname': 'randomsite3.com', ...}}
]
```
